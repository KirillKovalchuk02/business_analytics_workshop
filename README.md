This is my part of the code for the group assignment for a university Master code. It focuses on analysing the regional representation of an insurance company's customers in NL, based on demographics and internal data on company's customers. 

The code uses some Machine Learning approaches like PCA, Random Forests and others to perform extensive feature selection to better explain and predict the representation patterns.
